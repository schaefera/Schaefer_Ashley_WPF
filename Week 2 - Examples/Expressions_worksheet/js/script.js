   /* Label the section of code appropriately with comments
   	- Write the givens as appropriately named variables or constants.
   	- Declare a variable for your result.
	- Use the variables to calculate the result (NOT the literal values or numbers)
    - Calculate the result using the variables in an expression
    - Assign the calculation to the resulting variable.
    - Make sure to print the result in the console (Remember to include units like “feet” and “slices of pizza”)
    - Comment every line of code (describe what each line is doing in English)
    
    Example:
    Problem: Calculate the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle.
		Givens:
    		The width of the rectangle
    		The height of the rectangle.

		Result Variable:
		    The area of the rectangle.

		Result to Print:
    		“The circumference of the circle is x”;

		Example problem as it should appear in your code.
		//Calculate the Circumference of a Circle
		var radius = 6;
		const PI = 3.14159265;

		//multiply 2, PI and the radius & assign to circ variable.
		var circ = radius * 2 * PI;
		//print out the output circumference
		console.log(“The circumference of the circle is “ + circ );

//DOG YEARS
	//Problem: Calculate how old Sparky is in dog years, given his actual age in human years?
	
	//Calculate the Dog's age in dog years
	var humanAge = 2; 
	var dogAge = humanAge * 7; 
	//print out the output of dogAge which is Sparky's age in dog years
	console.log("Sparky is " + humanAge + " human years old which is " + dogAge + " in dog years.");
	

//SLICE OF PIE PART 1
	//Problem: How many slices of pizza will each person get, given slices per pizza, number of pizzas, and number of people?
	
	//Calculate  the number of slices there will be total
	var slices = 8; //Slices per pizza
	var pizzas = 5;

	//Calculate the number of slices per person
	var people = 10; //number of people at party
	var slicePerPerson = sliceTotal / people;
	
	console.log("Each person ate " + slicePerPerson + " slices of pizza at the party.");
